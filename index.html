          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

          Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
          legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment
          to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'.
          From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
          responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a
          country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
          territories, this means that the potential for variations between
          states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary
          education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are
          created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and
          policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the
          majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of
          government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the
          number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6
          83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were
          managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private
          management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools
          established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative
          learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are
          'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is
          shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio
          73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in
          urban areas much lower (36:66)

          In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
          for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission
          surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for
          female.[8] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%,
          53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[9] India's
          improved education system is often cited as one of the main
          contributors to its economic development.[10][11] Much of the
          progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has
          been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in
          higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching
          a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019,[12] there still
          remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education
          enrolment levels of developed nations,[13] a challenge that will be
          necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic
          dividend from India's comparatively young population.
